          Hello everyone, I'm Jordan Belfort. Being a Wall Street broker has
          been my life. I was a powerful and successful broker who made millions
          of dollars a year. I lived a life of luxury, driving luxury cars,
          flying private jets and traveling all over the world. But, as you
          know, all good things come to an end. I started abusing drugs and
          alcohol and my life started to go downhill. I lost all the money I
          made and ended up in jail for fraud and money laundering. I spent
          several years in prison, where I thought about my life and decided to
          change. After my release, I started again. I became involved in
          training and motivation to help others not make the same mistakes that
          I did. I wrote the book "The Wolf of Wall Street" where I shared my
          experience and the lessons I learned from my mistakes. I am sure that
          every person can change his life for the better if he works on himself
          and is not afraid to make mistakes. I am grateful that I was able to
          get through the hardships and become the best version of myself. I
          hope my experience will help someone change their life for the better.
          Thanks for listening to me.
        </p>
